                        <h3>Enterprise Application Software (EAS)</h3>
                        <div>
                            <p>Prematix develops Enterprise Software. Sometimes called Enterprise Application 
                                Software (EAS) is software that is designed to make small, medium, and large 
                                companies run more efficiently. Some examples of enterprise software includes: 
                                customer relationship management (CRM), content management, point of sale (POS), 
                                parts ordering, fractional ownership software, resource planning, and similar 
                                types of integrated IT solutions. Most businesses that are looking for enterprise 
                                software are looking for a solution by which they can build their entire business
                                upon. If developed correctly, EAS can take care of all of your selling, billing, 
                                shipping, and intercompany communication needs.</p>

                        <h3>Desktop Application Development</h3>
                        <div>
                            <p>Desktop software is highly recommended for its high speed and smooth performance. 
                                The desktop solution is rich in features, functionality, and user experience. And, 
                                unlike web based solutions, a desktop app is also not limited by the rules and scope 
                                of a web browser. With desktop hard clients, your software will always be at the 
                                forefront of your device, and not bound by – or intertwined with – 
                                the functionality of a web browser.</p>
