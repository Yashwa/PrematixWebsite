                                Do your processes help you achieve your business goals? Or are your processes
                                actually starting to limit these goals? In today's complex multi-geography
                                operational landscape, your process limitations could make you less agile -
                                curtailing your competitive edge. And retooling your processes in pockets may
                                not produce results. What you need is a transformation partner who understands
                                your processes and catalyzes change - by drafting a holistic model that
                                weaves together operations, strategy, technology, and business goals. A
                                partner who sees the 'bigger picture'.

                            <p>The Business Transformation Services practice follows a five-step approach in
                                enabling clients to transform their processes more effectively and efficiently
                                while implementing continous process improvements. Our five-step approach
                                typically kicks off with a diagnosis led by the Infosys Business Value
                                Framework (BVF). This is followed by defining future state processes and the
                                right operating model, establishing the model, and managing process
                                performance. This practitioner-led consulting approach leverages our
                                repository of proven tools and frameworks.

                                models, technology as an enabler to technology as a multiplier, process
                                metrics to business metrics, and static knowledge to dynamic knowledge.
