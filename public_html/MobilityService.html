                        <p>Untether, unlock, unleash – mobility: the art of the possible.<br>
                            Mobility has been accepted as the most disruptive technology innovation faced by 
                            enterprises today. In the past few years, mobile devices have evolved from just 
                            providing enterprise email and data on the move, to introducing applications and 
                            services that have the potential to change the way companies do business. Mobility can 
                            help companies leverage contextual data to reach out to their customers more effectively.
                        </p>

                        <p>Mobile technologies today have untethered businesses from their fixed location, 
                            unlocked immense value, and unleashed innovative solutions to further help businesses. 
                            Enterprises are at the cusp of realizing the immense potential of mobility. However, 
                            companies encounter challenges in their journey to unlock the opportunities offered by
                            mobile devices.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Challenges and opportunities</h3> 
                        <p><b>Create new mobile-driven business processes:</b> The adoption of smartphones
                            has reached even the traditionally non-mobile sections of the workforce. With 
                            the disappearance of the business / consumer divide in terms of adoption of 
                            technologies, companies are increasingly forced to revamp their business 
                            processes, in order to realize the potential benefits of mobiles. These new 
                            business processes are centered on the concept of mobility, which involve 
                            technologies such as cloud and analytics, and use context-driven and location-
                            aware data to influence the way companies function.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Define new business models for mobile implementation:</b> The speed of 
                            innovation of mobile technologies, combined with multiplicity of platforms 
                            and releases, has stretched the resources of companies. Mobility today offers 
                            newer business streams, but managing mobile implementation has become a much 
                            more complex affair. Companies need to look beyond the models they have been 
                            using to manage their IT and look for mobility-specific business models such 
                            as on-demand provisioning, pay-per-use pricing, and the ‘free+premium’ model 
                            for app usage.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>IT policies vs. smartphone app explosion:</b> The availability of sleeker, 
                            better-equipped phones in the market are throwing the traditional IT policies 
                            in the backseat. Companies are facing tremendous pressures from their employees
                            for better devices, or worse still, to adopt a ‘bring your own device’ policy. 
                            The implications of such policies for security are tremendous. These pressures
                            add complexity to management of apps and devices for companies.
