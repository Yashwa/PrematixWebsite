                        Advancements such as cloud, social, mobile and analytics are placing greater demands
                        on your IT infrastructure. But hardware-centric, inefficient infrastructures struggle
                        to support market shifts. Systems Services from Prematix helps you integrate traditional
                        systems and new architectures—like cloud—into a dynamic, open-standards-based
                        infrastructure. We help create a software-defined environment that uses patterns of
                        expertise to automatically anticipate and deploy infrastructure resources based on
                        workload needs. We offer a flexible approach that can address your needs at any
                        point in your service optimization journey.

                    <h3>Prematix's vision for the next-generation data center</h3>
                    <p>
                        The next-generation data center answers the need for a simpler, adaptive
                        infrastructure, able to respond to disruptive change, melt technology silos
                        and integrate legacy and new architectures in a single, manageable ecosystem.
                        It is a software defined environment (SDE) in which server, storage, network and
                        facilities resources are automatically provisioned and configured by software
                        programmed to understand and adapt decisions to the requirements of each workload
                        in real time.
